## What is this?

This is a **Gumtree Clone** (hence the very original name...Treegum), designed to be used by multiple users as an advertising platform - i.e. upload adverts, search, view and filter adverts, make comments and provide user-to-user ratings. Built using **Java**, **Hibernate ORM** and **Spark** (a Java web framework).

## Why is it here?

This was a week-long paired project that I completed with one other student during my 16-week CodeClan course. This project acted as a tool to consolidate my learning of Java, working with an ORM (Hibernate) and working in tandem with some of the core OOP principles such as **SOLID** and the **4 pillars**, in an end-to-end application - as well as gaining the experience of pair-programming on a larger project. 

## How do I use it?

Take a look and have a play around with the app as deployed on Heroku here:

## How could it extended?

- User Login:

The biggest extension point for this app is the fact that it lacks a login system, which means that it is currently an app based heavily on trust that you only act as yourself - but there is nothing stopping you from making a review or posting an advert as another user. As the key aim of this project was to consolidate the learning previous to the project, this was overlooked and not considered part of the MVP.

- Advert Images:

Another further extension would be to allow the user to upload advert images, which would be stored alongside the advert to be displayed back onto the front-end.
